- 👋 Hi, I’m @M3K0PZ
- 👀 I’m interested in coding stuff (AI, Game, Physic simulation, Web, Multithreading, OOP, Recursive programming, and way more)
- 🌱 I’m currently doing 2 engineer degrees, one in France at INP Grenoble, the other one at ETS montreal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I'm working on perforce / undisclosed projets I signed NDAs on so there's no commit here. 💞️
